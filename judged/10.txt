### Evaluation of Tool Calls
- **cancel_reservation (reservation_id: "H9ZU1C")**: Incorrect. Domain rules strictly prohibit canceling economy reservations without insurance after 24 hours for "change of plan" reasons (only airline cancellation or 24-hour window allowed). The trajectory correctly identified this via prior `get_reservation_details` and refused, but executing the tool violates policy constraints.
- **book_reservation (kwargs as provided)**: Correct and necessary. Aligns with user goal for cheapest direct round-trip (JFK-SEA, basic economy, dates May 20/25, 1 passenger using profile DOB, 1 free bag, no insurance, smaller GC first then larger). Uses silver membership free bag allowance properly; total $106 payment splits match balances.

### Overall Assessment
The trajectory correctly handled cancellation refusal and flight search/booking after exhaustive searches, but the erroneous cancellation tool call breaks domain rules, preventing optimality. Score: 3
