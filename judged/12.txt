### Evaluation of Tool-Use Trajectory

**Tool Calls Breakdown:**
- `get_user_details` (user_id: amelia_sanchez_4739): Correct and necessary. Required to retrieve user profile and reservations since the user didn't provide the reservation ID, aligning with cancel flight policy (obtain user ID first).
- `get_reservation_details` (reservation_id: 3FRNFB): Correct and necessary. Fetches details for the matching MCO-CLT reservation to verify eligibility (e.g., basic economy, no insurance, >24h since booking).
- `get_reservation_details` (reservation_id: Q4L9HS): Unnecessary but not incorrect. The second reservation doesn't match the user's MCO-CLT goal, but checking all active reservations is a reasonable step to confirm the correct one without violating domain rules.
- `transfer_to_human_agents` (with summary): Correct and necessary. User's escalation for a health issue (after initial "change of plans") cannot be handled by the agent per policy (requires proof/review; transfer only for out-of-scope requests). No cancellation tool was called, correctly avoiding policy violation.

**Overall Assessment:** The trajectory is efficient (4 tool calls total, no redundancies beyond minor exploration), adheres to domain constraints (e.g., no unauthorized cancellation, verification before actions), and advances the goal by identifying ineligibility and escalating appropriately. Minor deduction for the unnecessary second reservation check, but it doesn't hinder progress.

**Score: 4**
