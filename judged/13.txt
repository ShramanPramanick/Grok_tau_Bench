### Evaluation of Tool-Use Trajectory

**Tool Calls Analyzed:**
- `get_reservation_details` (reservation_id: XEWRD9): **Correct** – Necessary to retrieve details for modification assessment, aligning with domain rules requiring user ID and reservation ID for changes.
- `search_direct_flight` (ATL-LAS, 2024-05-21): **Correct** – Appropriate for exploring alternatives to meet the goal of a nonstop ATL-LAS flight, given modification constraints (basic economy, partial use, destination change).
- `get_user_details` (user_id: james_lee_6136): **Correct** – Necessary to access payment methods and profile for booking a new reservation.
- `search_direct_flight` (ATL-DFW, 2024-05-21): **Unnecessary** – Searches original return segment; not needed for the new LAS booking but doesn't violate intent.
- `book_reservation` (first attempt, HAT174 with single gift card): **Correct** – Directly advances the goal by attempting the new one-way booking per user confirmation.
- `book_reservation` (second attempt, HAT174 with two gift cards, amount mismatch): **Correct** – Iterative retry based on error feedback; aligns with payment rules.
- `book_reservation` (third attempt, HAT174 with adjusted amounts): **Correct** – Successful completion of the new booking, fulfilling the core goal (nonstop ATL-LAS in economy, within time window, under $100 net fee after original pricing).

**Overall Assessment:** The trajectory correctly identifies modification impossibilities (per domain rules: basic economy can't change flights, partial reservation can't split, destination/trip type fixed) and pivots to a new one-way booking, which achieves the user's intent. All calls are policy-compliant (e.g., explicit confirmations, no unverified updates). Minor unnecessary search and two failed booking attempts (due to payment errors) slightly lengthen the path but are resolved efficiently without errors.
