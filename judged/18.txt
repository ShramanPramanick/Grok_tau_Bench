### Evaluation of Tool-Use Trajectory

**Tool Calls Analysis:**
- **get_reservation_details (reservation_id: SI5UKW)**: Correct and necessary. Aligns with domain rules for cancel flight (requires reservation ID verification first) and directly supports the user's goal of initiating cancellation by retrieving booking details to assess eligibility.
- **get_user_details (user_id: amelia_rossi_1297)**: Correct and necessary. Follows domain rules to confirm user profile (e.g., membership tier) after persistent negotiation attempts, ensuring policy compliance (e.g., no compensation for regular members without insurance) without violating constraints.
- **transfer_to_human_agents (summary provided)**: Correct and necessary. User's coercion (threats, demands for escalation) exceeds AI scope per policy ("transfer if request cannot be handled within scope"); no cancellation possible under strict rules (basic economy, no insurance, >24h), making transfer the appropriate escalation.

**Overall Assessment:** All tool calls are correct, necessary, and policy-compliant, forming an efficient trajectory: verify details, deny ineligible request, and transfer on escalation. No unnecessary or incorrect actions; avoids unauthorized modifications or refunds.

**Score:** 5
