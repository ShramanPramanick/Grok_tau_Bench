### Evaluation of Tool-Use Trajectory

**Tool Calls Analysis:**
- `get_user_details` (user_id: "aarav_ahmed_6699"): **Correct** – Necessary to retrieve user profile, reservations, and confirm silver membership for cancellation eligibility.
- `get_reservation_details` (reservation_id: "M20IZO"): **Correct** – Necessary to verify the specific flight details (JFK-MCO on May 22, economy, no insurance) and assess cancellation rules.
- `transfer_to_human_agents` (summary of issue): **Correct** – Appropriate after 3 denials (user goal allows stopping after 5 attempts); escalation fits domain policy for unresolvable requests without violating rules.

No tool calls were unnecessary or incorrect. The trajectory correctly identifies the reservation but adheres to strict cancellation rules (no insurance, >24h, non-qualifying reason), denying the request without attempting an invalid `cancel_reservation`. However, it ends prematurely without addressing the goal's second part (booking JFK-SFO on May 24), resulting in an incomplete path to the full user objective.

**Overall Score:** 3  
(Efficient for cancellation phase but suboptimal due to lack of progression to booking after escalation.)
