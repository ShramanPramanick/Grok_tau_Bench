### Evaluation of Tool-Use Trajectory

**Tool Calls Breakdown:**
- `get_user_details` (user_id: amelia_davis_8890): **Correct** – Necessary to retrieve user profile, including reservation list, as the first step for cancellation requests per domain rules.
- `get_reservation_details` (for 8C8K4E): **Correct** – Necessary to verify eligibility (e.g., business class, unflown status) before proceeding with cancellations.
- `get_reservation_details` (for UDMOP1, XAZ3C0, LU15PA, MSJ4OA, I6M8JQ, 4XGCCM): **Correct** – All necessary to assess each reservation's cancelability (e.g., cabin type, insurance, flight dates vs. current time 2024-05-15), ensuring compliance with strict policy rules like no cancellations for basic economy without insurance or flown segments.
- `cancel_reservation` (for 8C8K4E, LU15PA): **Correct** – Necessary and appropriate after explicit user confirmation ("YES") and eligibility verification; only eligible business class reservations were targeted, aligning with user intent to cancel all possible despite no-refund willingness.
- No calls for ineligible reservations (e.g., UDMOP1, XAZ3C0, MSJ4OA): Appropriate – Avoided incorrect actions by not violating domain constraints (e.g., no exceptions for non-qualifying reasons).

**Overall Assessment:** The trajectory is efficient and policy-compliant, fetching details only as needed to inform decisions and limiting cancellations to eligible cases. It respects user confirmation requirements and domain rules without unnecessary or incorrect calls, though it couldn't fulfill the full "all upcoming" goal due to constraints. Near-optimal for the scenario.
