### Evaluation of Tool-Use Trajectory

**Tool Calls Breakdown:**
- `get_user_details` (user_id: sophia_martin_4574): **Correct** – Necessary to retrieve the user's profile and list of reservation IDs to check for duplicates.
- `get_reservation_details` (7 calls for IDs: MFRB94, PUNERT, HSR97W, SE9KEL, FDZ0T5, HTR26G, 5BGGWZ): **Correct** – Essential to fetch flight details (dates, routes) for identifying overlaps on the same days, aligning with the goal of detecting and resolving duplicates.
- `cancel_reservation` (FDZ0T5): **Correct** – Appropriate for canceling one duplicate on May 17 after user confirmation and policy checks (business class, unflown, reason provided).
- `cancel_reservation` (HSR97W): **Correct** – Appropriate for canceling one duplicate on May 22 under the same conditions.

**Overall Assessment:** The trajectory is efficient and policy-compliant: it starts with profile retrieval, systematically checks all reservations to identify duplicates (May 17 and 22 overlaps), seeks user confirmation (reason and "yes"), and cancels only the specified ones without unnecessary actions. No violations of domain rules (e.g., cancellations are eligible, no unconfirmed updates). Minor length from checking all 7 reservations is justified for thoroughness, leading to a near-optimal path.

**Score: 5**
