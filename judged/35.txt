### Evaluation of Tool Calls
- **get_reservation_details (reservation_id: PEP4E0)**: Correct and necessary. The user's goal involves canceling or modifying a specific reservation, and domain rules require obtaining reservation details (e.g., cabin type, insurance status, creation date) to verify eligibility for cancellation, changes, or refunds before any action.
- **transfer_to_human_agents (summary: User needs to cancel/modify due to emergency, but ineligible per policy; insists on refund/override, refuses transfer)**: Correct and necessary. After exhausting options (cancellation ineligible due to >24h booking, basic economy, no insurance; date change impossible for basic economy; insurance cannot be added post-booking), the request cannot be handled within the agent's scope per policy ("transfer... if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions"). The transfer summary accurately captures the situation without violating user insistence (policy takes precedence).

### Overall Assessment
The trajectory is efficient: It starts with essential verification, provides policy-compliant explanations, attempts fallback options (e.g., suggesting upgrades), and escalates only after all automated paths fail. No unnecessary or incorrect calls; aligns with domain constraints (strict rules on basic economy) and user goal (prioritizes cancellation/refund, then alternatives, before transfer). Near-optimal handling of an ineligible request.
