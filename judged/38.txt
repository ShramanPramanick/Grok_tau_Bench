### Evaluation of Tool-Use Trajectory

**Tool Calls Breakdown:**
- `get_reservation_details` (with reservation_id "H8Q05L"): Correct and necessary. Directly supports verifying the booking details (e.g., insurance status, cabin type) to assess the refund request against domain rules (insurance is non-separable post-booking).
- `get_user_details` (with user_id "sophia_silva_7557"): Correct and necessary. Confirms user profile (e.g., membership tier "regular") to evaluate eligibility for exceptions or refunds, aligning with policy constraints on insurance and compensation.
- `transfer_to_human_agents` (with detailed summary): Correct and necessary. The request for partial insurance refund violates domain rules (cannot remove/cancel insurance independently without full reservation cancellation, no API support for this). Policy mandates transfer for out-of-scope requests, especially after escalation demand.

**Overall Assessment:** The trajectory is efficient (3 targeted calls, no redundancy), adheres to domain constraints (e.g., no unauthorized modifications, proper verification before denial), and optimally escalates an unhandleable request. No incorrect or unnecessary actions.

**Score:** 5
