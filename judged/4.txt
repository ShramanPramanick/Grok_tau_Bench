### Evaluation of Tool Calls
- **update_reservation_flights**: Correct and necessary. Appropriately upgrades cabin to economy while retaining the same flights (HAT056 and HAT138 on 2024-05-25), uses specified gift card for payment difference, and aligns with domain rules for cabin changes without altering origin/destination.
- **update_reservation_passengers**: Correct and necessary. Changes passenger to Omar Rossi (using DOB from profile, as preferred), maintains 1 passenger count, and complies with rules allowing passenger modifications without number changes.
- **update_reservation_baggages**: Correct and necessary. Adds 3 checked bags (all free for gold member in economy), uses specified gift card (no charge needed), and follows rules for adding baggage post-booking.

### Overall Assessment
The trajectory is efficient, sequential, and fully achieves the goal (passenger change, economy upgrade, 3 bags, gift card payment) without violations. It includes prior necessary steps (e.g., identifying reservation via get_reservation_details calls) and adheres to policies like one tool call at a time and user confirmation. No unnecessary or incorrect actions; near-optimal length.
