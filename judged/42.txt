### Evaluation of Tool-Use Trajectory

**Tool Calls Analysis:**
- `get_user_details` (user_id: "anya_garcia_5901"): Correct and necessary. Domain rules for cancellation require verifying user ID and profile (e.g., membership, saved passengers) to confirm eligibility before proceeding.
- `get_reservation_details` (reservation_id: "3RK2T9"): Correct and necessary. Essential for checking reservation specifics (e.g., cabin class, insurance status, booking date, flights) to validate cancellation rules, especially for health-related claims requiring insurance.
- `transfer_to_human_agents` (with summary): Correct and necessary. After repeated user insistence on insurance (contradicting tool data showing "no" insurance), and inability to process cancellation per strict policy (basic economy, >24h, no insurance), escalation is required as the request cannot be handled within agent scope.

**Overall Assessment:** The trajectory is efficient (3 targeted calls, no redundancy), adheres to domain constraints (verifies facts before denial/escalation, avoids unauthorized actions like forced cancellation), and aligns with user goal by attempting verification and properly escalating when blocked. No incorrect or unnecessary calls; near-optimal handling of policy limits.

**Score:** 5
