### Evaluation of Tool-Use Trajectory

**Tool Calls Analysis:**
- `get_reservation_details` (reservation_id: "3RK2T9"): Correct and necessary. Retrieves current passenger details to verify the name change request (from Mei Lee to Mei Garcia) and ensure compliance with domain rules (e.g., no change in passenger count, basic economy constraints).
- `update_reservation_passengers` (reservation_id: "3RK2T9", passengers: [Anya Garcia, Mei Garcia]): Correct and necessary. Directly implements the verified name change after obtaining explicit user confirmation ("YES"), adhering to policy requirements for updates. No violations of domain constraints (e.g., passenger count unchanged, no payment needed).

**Overall Assessment:** The trajectory is efficient (only two tool calls), policy-compliant (details listed and confirmed before update, one tool call at a time), and directly achieves the goal without unnecessary actions or deviations. Near-optimal handling of a passenger name modification.

**Score:** 5
