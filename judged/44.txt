### Evaluation of Tool-Use Trajectory

**Tool Calls Analysis:**
- `get_reservation_details` (reservation_id: "JMO1MG"): Correct and necessary. Retrieves essential details (e.g., passengers=2, cabin=economy, current baggages=1) to compute suitcase allowance for the specific flight.
- `get_user_details` (user_id: "anya_garcia_5901"): Correct and necessary. Confirms membership tier (silver), which directly impacts bag allowance rules (2 free per economy passenger for silver).
- `get_user_details` (user_id: "anya_garcia_5901", repeated later): Unnecessary. The membership was already verified earlier; this redundant call adds length without new value, though it doesn't violate intent or constraints.

**Overall Assessment:** The trajectory efficiently gathers required data to calculate and provide the numeric total (4 free suitcases), aligning with the goal despite the user's incorrect gold assumption. Minor redundancy slightly lengthens the path, but no incorrect calls or policy violations (e.g., no unconfirmed updates attempted).

**Score:** 4
