### Evaluation of Tool-Use Trajectory

**Goal Summary**: The user (Raj Sanchez, ID: raj_sanchez_7340) wants to cancel reservation MZDDS4, referencing phone rep approval. Domain rules require obtaining user ID, reservation ID, and cancellation reason; verifying eligibility (e.g., business class allows cancellation); listing details and getting explicit confirmation before updating the database; and ensuring the entire unf flown trip is canceled.

**Tool Calls Analysis**:
- `get_user_details` (user_id: "raj_sanchez_7340"): **Correct**. Necessary to retrieve user profile, including reservation list, as user provided ID but not reservation ID. Aligns with policy to verify details before actions; enables lookup without violating constraints.
- `get_reservation_details` (reservation_id: "MZDDS4"): **Correct**. Essential after user specifies the reservation and reason; allows verification of eligibility (business class, future flights, >24 hours but cancellable), baggage/insurance, and payment for refund processing. Precedes confirmation as required.

**Overall Assessment**: Both calls are necessary, sequential, and directly support the goal without redundancy or violations (e.g., no premature updates; confirmation obtained before `cancel_reservation`). Trajectory is efficient (minimal steps, policy-compliant), leading to successful cancellation. No unnecessary or incorrect calls.

**Score**: 5
