### Evaluation of Tool Calls
- **update_reservation_flights**: Correct and necessary. Handles cabin upgrade to economy (with payment) while preserving flights, aligning with user goal and domain rules (cabin changes allowed; payment required for difference).
- **update_reservation_passengers**: Correct and necessary. Updates passenger to user (Omar Rossi) without changing count, per domain rules (passenger modifications allowed if count unchanged).
- **update_reservation_baggages**: Correct and necessary. Adds 3 checked bags (all free for gold member in economy), with payment specified (though $0 cost), fulfilling the goal.

### Overall Assessment
The trajectory correctly identifies the relevant reservation (FQ8APE, matching NYC-CHI route), obtains confirmation before updates, uses preferred gift card payment, avoids DOB input (from profile), and applies all changes in a logical sequence. No violations of domain constraints (e.g., no flight changes, passenger count preserved). Minor note: Final response incorrectly states cabin as "basic_economy" despite update, but tool outputs confirm intent. Efficient and near-optimal.
