### Evaluation of Tool Calls
- **cancel_reservation (K1NW8N)**: Correct and necessary. The original reservation was basic economy, which cannot be modified for itinerary changes per domain rules. User explicitly requested cancellation to enable rebooking in business class, and it qualifies (within 24 hours, full refund).
- **book_reservation (Mohamed Silva)**: Correct and necessary. Aligns with user's goal to book cheapest business round-trip (same dates/itinerary), uses specified payments (one certificate + all gift cards + minimal credit card), no baggage/insurance, single passenger to enable multiple certificates.
- **book_reservation (Raj Sanchez)**: Correct and necessary. Matches the separate booking strategy to use all certificates, with specified payment (certificate + credit card for rest), same itinerary/details.
- **book_reservation (Liam Wilson)**: Correct and necessary. Same as above, completing the three separate bookings to minimize credit card usage while fulfilling the goal.

### Overall Assessment
All tool calls are correct, necessary, and efficient, directly achieving the user's goals (balances checked earlier via other tools, cancellation + rebooking with optimal payments, total credit card charge minimized to $1,286). No violations of domain rules (e.g., one certificate per booking, passenger limits, no insurance/bags). Trajectory is near-optimal in length and adherence to user intent.
