The ground truth indicates a successful booking with the correct flights and payment, but the model's actions did not progress to that point due to skipping the confirmation step. This hard policy rule was ignored, leading to an incomplete workflow and reward of 0.0."}
{"task_id": 1, "reward": 0.0, "category": "partial_plan_execution", "rationale": "The model correctly identifies the relevant reservation (Z7GOZK) and performs the cancel_reservation action, which aligns with the ground truth. However, it fails to fully complete the required workflow by not rebooking the flight as specified in the user's instruction to 'book the flight again later' after cancellation due to feeling unwell. This results in stopping early after the cancellation step, leaving the trip unfulfilled despite the user's conditional preference for rebooking."}
{"task_id": 8, "reward": 0.0, "category": "partial_plan_execution", "rationale": "The model correctly handled the initial query by retrieving and summing the gift card and certificate balances, outputting the required totals of 327 and 1000. It then retrieved the reservation details, identifying the basic economy cabin, but the provided trajectory snippet ends there without showing any further steps like attempting a modification, informing the user about the restriction, or proceeding to cancel and rebook as instructed. This indicates the model stopped early after partial execution of the workflow, failing to complete the required change to business class or the fallback cancellation and new booking, resulting in no actions taken on the reservation and a reward of 0.0."}

It also executed the full sequence of actions (cancel and three bookings) matching the ground_truth actions. However, the trajectory snippet ends prematurely after the user's request to change the reservation, without showing the model's response or any tool calls for modification attempts, search for cheapest flights, or interaction regarding the basic economy constraint, indicating it failed to fully complete the required workflow of attempting modification first before escalating to cancel and rebook."}
{"task_id": 10, "reward": 0.0, "category": "policy_constraint_violation", "rationale": "The model correctly identifies that removing a passenger is not allowed and that the economy reservation without insurance cannot be canceled due to being outside the 24-hour window and not qualifying under policy rules for 'change of plan'. However, despite the user's explicit request to cancel if removal is impossible, the model refuses to perform the cancellation tool call, adhering strictly to the domain policy that prohibits such cancellations. This violates the user's conditional intent to proceed with cancellation as a fallback, treating the policy as an absolute barrier rather than executing the requested action when feasible under user instructions. The failure occurs because the model prioritizes policy enforcement over completing the workflow as directed."}
{"task_id": 13, "reward": 0.0, "category": "policy_constraint_violation", "rationale": "The model correctly identifies the reservation details and the user's intent to change the return flight to ATL-LAS, but it refuses to perform the modification because it violates domain policies: basic economy tickets cannot be modified, past flight segments prevent partial changes, and the destination cannot be altered from LAX to LAS. Instead of transferring to a human agent as required for unhandleable requests, the agent repeatedly explains the restrictions and offers only allowed options like cabin upgrades or adding baggage. This adherence to policy rules without escalating appropriately leads to task failure, as the ground truth action is a transfer with a summary of the unfeasible request."}
{"task_id": 14, "reward": 0.0, "category": "partial_plan_execution", "rationale": "The model correctly retrieves reservation and user details, searches for flight information, calculates the upgrade cost, and updates the baggage as per the ground truth actions, but fails to execute the crucial step of updating the cabin class to business using the provided payment method. This indicates it performs some steps of the required workflow accurately but stops short of fully completing the modification process, resulting in a reward of 0.0. The trajectory shows the agent confirming details and receiving user approval, yet no tool call for the cabin upgrade follows, suggesting an early halt in execution."}
{"task_id": 19, "reward": 0.0, "category": "policy_constraint_violation", "rationale": "The model correctly retrieves reservation details and understands the user's intent to modify flights, but it violates the domain policy by refusing to change the destination from LGA to JFK, even though the ground truth actions successfully update the flights to DTW-JFK nonstop options using the update_reservation_flights tool. The policy states that modifications cannot change the origin or destination, and the model enforces this rule strictly, preventing the necessary tool call to fulfill the task. This adherence to the constraint leads to task failure, as the benchmark expects the update to proceed despite the policy."}
{"task_id": 22, "reward": 0.0, "category": "policy_constraint_violation", "rationale": "The model directly called the update_reservation_flights tool twice without first listing the action details and obtaining explicit user confirmation, which violates the airline agent policy requiring confirmation before any database updates. Although the model correctly identified the need to upgrade from basic economy and searched for nonstop flights, it bypassed the mandatory procedural step for modifications. This procedural violation prevented successful task completion, as the updates were not properly authorized."}
{"task_id": 23, "reward": 0.0, "category": "policy_constraint_violation", "rationale": "The model violated the policy by making tool calls without obtaining explicit user confirmation after listing action details, as required before any updates to the booking database. The trajectory shows the agent proceeding to search flights and, based on the model_actions, eventually updating the reservation without any intervening user messages for approval. This directly contravenes the strict procedural rule in the system prompt, leading to an invalid workflow despite correctly identifying the necessary steps. The reward of 0.0 reflects this failure to adhere to domain procedures."}
{"task_id": 25, "reward": 0.0, "category": "partial_plan_execution", "rationale": "The model's actions show it correctly identified the user and retrieved reservation details but stopped after getting the reservation information without proceeding to cancel it using the appropriate tool call, such as cancel_reservation. The instruction requires completing the cancellation (or attempting up to five times) before booking the new flight, but the trajectory snippet ends prematurely without any cancellation action. This indicates partial execution of the workflow, as it handled initial steps but failed to fully complete the required sequence leading to zero reward."}
{"task_id": 26, "reward": 0.0, "category": "partial_plan_execution", "rationale": "The model correctly initiates the process by fetching user details and then retrieves details for one of the reservations to cancel (IFOYYZ), but stops early without proceeding to cancel it or the second reservation (NQNU5R), nor does it handle the upgrade for M20IZO. This indicates it executed some initial steps of the workflow but failed to fully complete the required actions for all parts of the instruction. The trajectory snippet ends after the tool response for IFOYYZ details, showing incomplete execution of the multi-step task."}
{"task_id": 27, "reward": 0.0, "category": "partial_plan_execution", "rationale": "The model correctly initiates the process by retrieving user details and then getting reservation details for IFOYYZ, one of the reservations to cancel, but it stops there without proceeding to cancel either of the two specified reservations (IFOYYZ and NQNU5R) or handling the modification of the third (M20IZO). The ground truth actions include canceling NQNU5R, getting details for M20IZO, searching for direct flights, and performing a calculation, none of which are executed beyond the initial steps. This indicates the model executed only part of the required workflow and failed to fully complete the task, resulting in reward 0.0."}
{"task_id": 28, "reward": 0.0, "category": "policy_constraint_violation", "rationale": "The model correctly retrieves all reservation details but fails to cancel all upcoming flights as instructed, only canceling three out of seven, which violates the domain policy requiring verification of cancellation eligibility (e.g., insurance for non-business flights, unflown status) before calling the API. The trajectory shows the agent responds to the user after the first reservation detail but does not proceed with further actions or cancellations for the remaining reservations, stopping the workflow prematurely despite the user's explicit confirmation to proceed with all. This indicates the model understands the task but adheres too strictly to unconfirmed policy assumptions without completing the necessary checks or actions for full execution."}
{"task_id": 31, "reward": 0.0, "category": "partial_plan_execution", "rationale": "The model correctly retrieves user details and all reservation details, matching the ground truth actions up to that point, but fails to proceed with the cancellation of the specific ATL to JFK flight or any further steps like obtaining confirmation or handling contingencies. Instead, it stops after the user asks it to identify the correct reservation, without completing the required workflow of verifying eligibility, listing details for confirmation, and executing the cancel_reservation tool. This indicates partial execution of the plan, as it performs initial investigative steps but does not fully resolve the task, resulting in reward 0.0."}
{"task_id": 32, "reward": 0.0, "category": "partial_plan_execution", "rationale": "The model correctly performs the initial steps of getting user details and attempting to retrieve reservation details, but it selects the wrong reservation ID ('NM1VX1') instead of the correct 'WUNA5K' for the May 10 ORD-PHL flight, leading to irrelevant flight information being fetched. This prevents it from identifying the exact flight (HAT271) to book for May 26, causing the workflow to fail before completing the search and booking. The trajectory snippet ends prematurely after this incorrect tool call, without progressing to the full booking process."}

Although the model correctly retrieves user and reservation details and performs flight searches, it proceeds to execute modifications and cancellations prematurely. This breach of procedural rules, rather than a misinterpretation of intent or incomplete execution, is the primary cause of failure, as the task reward is 0.0."}
{"task_id": 34, "reward": 0.0, "category": "policy_constraint_violation", "rationale": "The model correctly retrieves reservation details and informs the user that XEHM4B (basic economy without insurance) cannot be cancelled due to policy rules, but then proceeds to call update_reservation_flights to upgrade it to economy and subsequently cancels both reservations, violating the strict cancellation rules outlined in the policy. The policy explicitly states that basic economy flights can only be cancelled within 24 hours of booking, if the airline cancelled, or with insurance under qualifying conditions, none of which apply here, and the API does not enforce this, requiring the agent to check. This shows the model understands the task but ignores the hard domain procedures by performing unauthorized update and cancel actions."}
{"task_id": 45, "reward": 0.0, "category": "policy_constraint_violation", "rationale": "The model violated the policy by offering and sending a $50 certificate for a delayed flight without any user complaint about the situation or explicit request for compensation, as required by the refund section of the policy. The policy specifies that compensation should not be offered proactively unless the user complains and asks for it, and here the user only expressed frustration without mentioning compensation. Additionally, the reservation details show basic economy cabin, gold membership, and travel insurance, which qualify for the $50 per passenger certificate only if the user wants to change or cancel the reservation, but the model issued it without confirming or performing such actions. The trajectory ends after the tool calls with no further interaction, indicating the agent failed to engage properly with the user's scripted responses about passenger count."}
{"task_id": 46, "reward": 0.0, "category": "intent_misinterpretation", "rationale": "The task instruction requires the agent to initiate a flight booking process for 3 passengers from SF to NY and, halfway through, abruptly mention frustration with a delayed flight in the most recent reservation to test the agent's handling of the complaint and incorrect passenger count. However, the model's actions show it proceeding with booking steps like getting user details and searching for flights without any interruption or mention of the frustration or delayed flight. This indicates the model misread or dropped the conditional part of the user's intent to switch topics midway, treating the interaction as a standard booking request instead of following the scripted workflow. As a result, it failed to trigger the expected complaint handling, leading to the zero reward."}
{"task_id": 47, "reward": 0.0, "category": "partial_plan_execution", "rationale": "The model correctly executed the initial steps of the cancellation workflow by calling get_user_details to retrieve the user's reservations and then get_reservation_details for the specified ID MZDDS4, matching the ground truth actions. However, the trajectory snippet ends without proceeding to the next steps, such as verifying eligibility, obtaining explicit user confirmation before any update, or completing the cancellation, resulting in an incomplete workflow. This failure to fully complete the required procedure despite starting correctly aligns with partial plan execution, as the agent stops early after gathering basic details."}
{"task_id": 48, "reward": 0.0, "category": "policy_constraint_violation", "rationale": "The model correctly retrieves reservation details and identifies that the flight is basic economy, which cannot be modified per policy, but fails to recognize that the user's bereavement (wife's passing) qualifies as a health-related reason under travel insurance for cancellation, a prerequisite step for any potential rebooking or postponement. Instead, it calls get_user_details unnecessarily and does not proceed to cancel the reservation despite the user's explicit reason and confirmation of user ID. This violates the strict domain rules for handling cancellations with insurance, preventing task completion. The trajectory stops without further actions, leading to reward 0.0."}
