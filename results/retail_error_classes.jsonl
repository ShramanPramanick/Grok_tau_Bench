However, it outputs '1093.34' as a supposed refund amount without performing any cancellation or return actions, misinterpreting the user's primary intent to attempt partial cancellation of office items first and only fallback to address change if explicitly not possible. The policy requires checking order statuses and obtaining user confirmation before consequential actions, but the model skips exploring cancellation feasibility across the three orders and fabricates a refund without tool support. This indicates a misreading of the conditional preference to prioritize cancellation over modification."}
